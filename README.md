### Welcome to Rogha

Rogha is Irish for "choice".

It’s a simple social platform for friends — by friends. No ads. No noise. Actually social, in the way that matters. Just the people you choose to care about.

**Ar aghaidh linn.**

## 📰 Editions

**Editions** is a slower, more thoughtful kind of social posting. You write once a week — not constantly.

**The idea:**

- It’s not always on. Your feed waits for you.
- Weekly posts encourage reflection and creativity.
- Everyone shares together, at the same time.
- Small audiences make for honest expression.

To get started:

1. Add friends by email.
2. Visit Editions.
3. Write your first post.
